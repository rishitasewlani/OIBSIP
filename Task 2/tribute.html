                    Lakshmi Bai, sometimes spelt Laxmi Bai, was the ruler of Jhansi and an important participant in the
                    Indian Mutiny of 1857â€“1858. She was born on November 19, 1835, in Kashi, India, and died at
                    Kotah-ki-Serai, a town adjacent to Gwalior, on June 17, 1858. She was nurtured in the peshwa Baji
                    Rao II's family, which gave her an uncommon upbringing as a Brahman girl. She was brought up in the
                    peshwa's court, had martial arts training, and also possessed exceptional riding and sword fighting
                    abilities.

                Jhansi ki Rani married Gangadhar Rao, the maharaja of Jhansi, but she became widowed without bearing a
                heir to the kingdom. Just before he passed away, the maharaja adopted a boy as his heir in accordance
                with accepted Hindu tradition. The adoptive successor was not acknowledged by Lord Dalhousie, the
                British governor-general of India, who instead conquered Jhansi in accordance with the doctrine of
                lapse. To handle administrative matters, an East India Company representative was assigned to the little
                kingdom.
                The queen, who was 22 years old, resisted giving the Jhansi to the British. Lakshmi Bai was named the
                regent of Jhansi and ruled on behalf of the minor heir shortly after the 1857 revolt that started in
                Meerut got under way. She quickly organised her forces, joined the revolt against the British, and took
                command of the insurgents in the Bundelkhand region. Mutinies in the surrounding areas moved towards
                Jhansi to support her.
                By January 1858, the East India Company's forces had started their counteroffensive in Bundelkhand under
                the command of Gen. Hugh Rose. Rose advanced from Mhow, took Saugor (Sagar) in February, and turned
                her attention to Jhansi in March. A ferocious struggle broke out when the company's men encircled the
                fort of Jhansi. Even after her troops were overrun and the rescuing army of Tantia Tope, another rebel
                leader, was routed in the Battle of Betwa, Lakshmi Bai continued to fiercely resist the advancing
                forces. With the help of a small group of royal guards, Lakshmi Bai was able to flee the fort and travel
                to the east, where she was joined by other rebels.
                The city-fortress of Gwalior was then successfully attacked by Tantia Tope and Lakshmi Bai. A well-known
                man named Nana Sahib was declared the peshwa, the treasury and the armoury being taken. After
                capturing Gwalior, Lakshmi Bai marched to Morar in order to meet Rose's British counterattack. She
                engaged in a bloody fight while dressed as a guy and lost the war.
